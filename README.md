# POC REACT

The idea is build some components simulates app Front End. In This case i used React Library with another libraries for differents purposes explained
below.

## Analysis

### Learning Curve
The Library is very easy to use, it is fully integrated with "npm" , the syntax is ECMA6 and HTML.
The Documentation is not very clear, different stable versions changed key concepts, so it is absolutely necessary know well the using version of library .


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

First you must install modules declared in package.json using:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
